download the Grafana GPG key with wget, then pipe the output to apt-key. This will now add the key to your APT installationâ€™s list of trusted keys, which will then allow you to download as well as verify the GPG-signed Grafana package.
1. wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add
In the above command, the option -q helps turn off the status update message for wget, and -O will give the file you downloaded to the terminal. These two options make sure to pipeline only the contents of the downloaded file to apt-key.
2. sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
add the Grafana repository to your APT sources
3. sudo apt update 
4. apt-cache policy grafana 
5. sudo apt install grafana
6. sudo systemctl start grafana-server
7. sudo systemctl status grafana-server
8. sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
9. Access grafana via http://server_ip_address:3000
